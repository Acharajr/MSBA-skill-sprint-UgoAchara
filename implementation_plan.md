## What does this repo do in plain language?

This repo contains a collection of projects designed to help build a strong data portfolio, whether you are interested in SQL or Python. It offers a wide range of practical examples. For this review, I focused on a project centered on scraping data from a website. I had previously completed Track 1 in earlier questions and wanted to see how these concepts work in real time. Amazon was a natural choice due to the scale and structure of its data.

## What would you need to change to use it for a real company?

Since this project is built specifically around Amazon, the primary change would be the URL being scraped. For example, if the goal were to compare the highest-selling products between Amazon and Walmart within a specific category, the data source would need to be updated to scrape from Walmart as well, and the scraping logic adjusted to match Walmart’s site structure.
